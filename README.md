# 50.003-Software-Construction
Under 50.003 Software Construction, our group is tasked to work with Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise to implement a call center routing engine for their Rainbow API. This repository aims to provide companies who use the Rainbow communicating platform for their call centers with an efficient routing engine service.

For this project, we will be exploring and implementing the MEAN framework, using MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js. MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.
